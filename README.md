# hello-world
This is my first repo
What's up world of developers?? I have been involved in the tech industry for 18 years. I just started web development a few months back. I am finding HTML and CSS to be very interesting and am looking forward to adding it to my skill set. I am working at a slow pace, but hope to speed up soon. It is a huge change coming over from strictly hardware and networking. I am also working on Swift in Xcode at a much slower pace. I quickly realized that I couldn't really do both, at least in the beginning.
